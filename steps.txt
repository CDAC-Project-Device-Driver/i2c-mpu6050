1. Create the .dts file BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dts
2. Install sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
3. compile the .dts file to create .dtbo as per below command.
	dtc -O dtb -o BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dtbo -b 0 -@ BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dts
4.Copy the .dtbo file in the /lib/firmware (firmware directory) so that it can be loaded at the time of boot.
	sudo cp BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dtbo /lib/firmware/
5.Edit the uEnv.txt to apply the overlay at the time of boot.
	sudo vim /boot/uEnv.txt or sudo nano /boot/uEnv.txt
	make the changes as per given below to implement the uboot_overlay
		enable_uboot_overlays=1
		uboot_overlay_addr4=/lib/firmware/BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dtbo 	//as per available addr line
