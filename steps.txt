1. Create the .dts file BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dts
2. Install sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
3. compile the .dts file to create .dtbo as per below command.
3. compile the .dts file to create .dtbo as per below command.
	dtc -O dtb -o BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dtbo -b 0 -@ BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dts
4.Copy the .dtbo file in the /lib/firmware (firmware directory) so that it can be loaded at the time of boot.
	sudo cp BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dtbo /lib/firmware/
5.Edit the uEnv.txt to apply the overlay at the time of boot.
	sudo vim /boot/uEnv.txt or sudo nano /boot/uEnv.txt
	make the changes as per given below to implement the uboot_overlay
		enable_uboot_overlays=1
		uboot_overlay_addr4=/lib/firmware/BB-I2C2-MPU6050-00A0.dtbo 	//as per available addr line
6. After making all above changes i had reboot the beaglebone 
7. After rebooting it has thrown a error as per below.
	
	[   40.356079] inv-mpu6050-i2c 2-0068: trigger probe fail -22
	[   40.415151] dummy: Underflow of regulator enable count

8. Also it creates its own driver which is different than the created device driver.

to load dtbo file at the time of booting.

1. copy i2c_mpu6050.ko file in /lib/modules/5.10.168-ti-r71/
2. after copying sudo depmod to add the dependencies.
3. sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/module.conf      //optional
4. need to add the changes in modprobe.d/module.conf  
5. sudo chmod +x /etc/modprobe.d/module.conf    //to add the permission to write.
